      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and
            pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water
             or milk for a fluffier texture. </li>
        <li> Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat
            and add butter or oil.
        </li>
            <li> Cook the omelette: Once the butter is
             melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs.
              Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
        <li> Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the
            edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
             your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li> Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li> Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
